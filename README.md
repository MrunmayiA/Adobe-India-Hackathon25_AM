# Adobe India Hackathon 2025 - Connecting the Dots

## Round 1A: Understand Your Document

---

## 📘 README.md

### 🧠 Overview

This project is built for **Round 1A** of the **Adobe India Hackathon 2025 - Connecting the Dots Challenge**. The goal is to build a document intelligence engine that extracts a structured outline (title, headings H1, H2, H3) from a PDF file in a hierarchical format, offline, using a Dockerized Python solution.

### ⚙️ How to Build and Run (Offline Mode)

#### Docker Build

```bash
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t outlineextractor:adobe25 .
```

#### Docker Run

```bash
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/input:/app/input -v $(pwd)/output:/app/output --network none outlineextractor:adobe25
```

---

### 📥 Input

* One or more PDF files (up to 50 pages each) placed in `/app/input/`

---

### 📤 Output

* One `.json` file for each `.pdf` file in `/app/output/`, matching this structure:

```json
{
  "title": "Understanding AI",
  "outline": [
    { "level": "H1", "text": "Introduction", "page": 1 },
    { "level": "H2", "text": "What is AI?", "page": 2 },
    { "level": "H3", "text": "History of AI", "page": 3 }
  ]
}
```

---

### 🧪 Dependencies

* Python 3.10+
* PyMuPDF (`fitz`)
* numpy

Install via:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 📌 Approach

#### Title Extraction

* Extracted as the **largest bold text** on the **first page**, center-aligned or top-most.

#### Heading Detection (H1, H2, H3)

* Logic based on a combination of:

  * Font size clustering (k-means or rule-based)
  * Font weight (boldness)
  * Position on page (top-aligned, left-aligned)
  * Distance from surrounding text (spacing)
* Use heuristics to generalize across PDF layouts
* Avoid file-specific logic

## 📄 brd.md (Business Requirement Document)

### 🎯 Objective

Build a scalable, offline-capable system that extracts semantic outlines from PDFs with structured hierarchy to enable future semantic search, navigation, and summarization features.

---

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria

* [x] Accepts a PDF via `/app/input/`
* [x] Extracts document title from first page
* [x] Detects H1, H2, H3 headings across the document
* [x] Returns a valid structured JSON in `/app/output/`
* [x] Runs in <10s for a 50-page document
* [x] Uses CPU only (no GPU)
* [x] All dependencies inside Docker (no pip install at runtime)
* [x] Docker compatible with linux/amd64
* [x] No internet usage

---

### 🔍 Functional Requirements

* Extract document title based on font size/position/boldness
* Identify hierarchy of headings via clustering/rules
* Track page numbers accurately
* Output format validation

---

### 📉 Non-Functional Requirements

* Lightweight and modular
* Runs offline on low-resource machines
* Error handling for corrupt or empty PDFs
* Scalable for 3–5 concurrent documents in later phases (Round 1B)

---

### 🔄 Future Scope (Round 1B Ready)

* Reuse outline extraction in multi-PDF setup
* Semantic search based on headings and persona-task matching
* Link related sections across documents
